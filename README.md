abstract = {In Software Engineering courses, students typically work in groups to collaborate on team projects. However, contributions to these projects are not always fairly distributed across team members and sometimes individuals are less consistent at making contributions over an academic term. This paper investigates discrepancies in the consistency of each member's contributions to software engineering teams. We studied 94 software engineering teams from undergraduate software engineering courses and gathered evidence of each member's (n=465) activities on GitHub, including commits, pull requests, issues, code reviews, and comments. We analyzed whether each member exhibited any of these activities for each week of the academic term to measure the consistency of their contributions. We calculated the (dis)parity of how consistently each team member made contributions using the Gini coefficient, which measures (in)equity within groups. Each team also self-reported their frequency of conflicts and cohesiveness toward a common goal. This exploratory study investigates the relationship between parity among teammates' consistency and the team's overall cohesiveness and lack of conflict. While parity of consistency varied between teams, there was no association between it and teams' cohesiveness or conflicts. However, median team consistency was a significant predictor of team cohesiveness and a lack of conflicts.},
